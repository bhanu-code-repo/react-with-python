# React with Python Projects

Welcome to the "React with Python Projects" repository! This repository contains a collection of projects that combine the power of React for the front-end and Python for the back-end. These projects are designed to showcase the capabilities of both technologies and provide practical examples of full-stack development.

## Project List

1. **Calculator Application:** A basic calculator application with a user-friendly interface. It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations and is built using React for the front-end and Python for the back-end.

2. **Number Guessing Game:** A simple number guessing game that challenges players to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game features a React front-end and a Python Flask back-end.
